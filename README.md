# Horiseon Social Solutions WEB-Modifications

## Description

As I began working on this project, I slowly realized that the semantic HTML structure for the Horiseon website is very weak, thus causing it to rank lower in Google SEO. Consequently, I decided to learn the semantic structure of HTML & CSS to improve the website's SEO ranking, reducing the need to spend more money on marketing.

Additionally, I chose to add comments to every line of code in the documentation to enhance code readability for developers in case of future issues. Moreover, the website had accessibility issues, making it challenging for individuals using assistive technologies to access the site. As a responsible developer, I identified and resolved these issues seamlessly, making the website more accessible and, consequently, improving its SEO ranking.

Furthermore, I adhered to the Scout rule, making the code cleaner than when I initially found it by adding comments, spacing, and other improvements. Lastly, I noticed that the CSS code was somewhat messy, so I enhanced its functionality by increasing efficiency, consolidating selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.
